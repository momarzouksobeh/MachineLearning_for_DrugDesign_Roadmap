| 1️⃣  [An Uncertainty-Guided Deep Learning Method Facilitates Rapid Screening of CYP3A4 Inhibitors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01241) | 🎯 [The central focus of the article]() : the utilization of DNN to enhance virtual screening for drug design purposes. <br> 📍 [The research gab]() : Existing models for predicting CYP inhibitors often lack precision and reliability. <br> 📍 [The new idea](): <br> 1) A new uncertainty-guided regression model accurately predicts IC50 values for anti-CYP3A4 activities. <br> 2) They compiled a comprehensive data set of CYP3A4 inhibitors consisting of27,045 compounds with classification labels. <br> 3) They integrated the predictions model trained on the dataset and and uncertainty ranking to achieve a high-precision regression model. <br> 4) They used the new integrated model to conduct virtual screening of an in-house compound set. In vitro experiments showed improved hit ratio and reduced false positives using the uncertainty indicator (new model). <br> 🏆 [The final conclusion](): <br> Incorporating uncertainty in compound screening shows promise for drug discovery and development. | - |
