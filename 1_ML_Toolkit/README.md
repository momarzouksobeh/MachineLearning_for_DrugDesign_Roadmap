In this section, ML Toolkit, we explore the diverse tools crucial for handling big data with ML models. Building these models necessitates the use of various Python libraries. For robust data analysis, we leverage essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. To construct and manage ML models effectively, we rely on powerful frameworks such as SciKit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch, and more. Additionally, we will cover a widely used cheminformatics toolkit in Python designed to handle chemical informatics and support drug discovery and design, such as RDKit.
