In this section, Full-Scale ML Projects Showcase, I have completed a set of complete ML projects and real case studies, including topics like car price prediction, image classification, and recommendation systems. These projects are designed for general ML practice, providing opportunities to delve deeper into understanding and implementing various machine learning algorithms in different application domains. 
The majority of these resources are presented in Jupyter Notebook format, facilitating easy experimentation and direct use for those interested in exploring ML applications in Drug Design or teaching related courses in the future.
