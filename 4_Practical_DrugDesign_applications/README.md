In this section, Practical Drug Design applications, as part of the main objective of this repository to master ML models for designing new drugs, I have practiced numerous projects and hands-on applications focused on drug design activities, such as virtual screening and docking. I am compiling all of these hands-on projects related to drug design applications in this section, with the hope that they may prove useful for other researchers.
The majority of these resources are presented in Jupyter Notebook format, facilitating easy experimentation and direct use for those interested in exploring ML applications in Drug Design or teaching related courses in the future.
